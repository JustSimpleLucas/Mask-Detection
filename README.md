# Mask-Detection
The project construct Convolutional Neutral Network (CNN) and EfficientnetB0 with Transfer Learning.
 to detect whether or not people wearing mask. By leveraging a pre-trained network, this model can be customized to detect masks in various settings. Transfer learning allows for the efficient adaptation of previously trained models to new tasks.
