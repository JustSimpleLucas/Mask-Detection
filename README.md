# Mask-Detection
The project constructed a Convolutional Neutral Network (CNN) and EfficientnetB0 with Transfer Learning.
 to detect whether or not people wear masks. This model can be customized to detect masks in various settings by leveraging a pre-trained network. Transfer learning allows for efficiently adapting previously trained models to new tasks.
The data set includes 17998 pictures in total, evenly divided into a training set and  a test set.
